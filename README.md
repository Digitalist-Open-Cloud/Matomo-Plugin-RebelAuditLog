# Rebel Audit Log

This plugin is an audit log for Matomo. Logging all important changes and actions in Matomo to the database, with the possibility to log to an external database and to export the audit logs in different formats.

## External database

For the audit log to persist, and not be part of application itself, there should be a possibility to keep audit logs separate from the application. If you add an external database to log to, you still have audit logs from Rebel Audit Log inside Matomo so you could compare and add an extra layer for the audit logs.
